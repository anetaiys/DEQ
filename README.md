	Diffusion Equation Quantification (DEQ)

	This calculation code provides:

	(1) DEQ calculation for input .csv image file (2D array)
		and output .csv images according to iterations as a list

	(2) Filter functions (DEQ_Filter_Function) are defined
		However, in the DEQ filter function, users can artbitrary 
		define a filter according to their puropose  

	If a researcher use this code, please refer to
		
		Diffusion equation quantification: selective enhancement algorithm
		for bone metastasis lesions in CT images
		(doi: xxxxxxxxx)
	
	and include the reference.
